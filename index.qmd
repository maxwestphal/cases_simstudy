# Overview {.unnumbered}

[Westphal \& Zapf, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13469) investigated different multiple comparison procedures (MCPs) for a certain type of analyis (e.g.) relevant in diagnostic accuracy studies, the so-called co-primary endpoint analysis.

The R package [cases](https://github.com/maxwestphal/cases/) contains user-friendly implementations of these MCPs.

This R project **cases_simstudy** contains a reproducible description of the implementation and results of this simulation study in form of a [quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books). The GitHub repository for this project is [github.com/maxwestphal/cases_simstudy](https://github.com/maxwestphal/cases_simstudy)

**This report is not meant to a standalone resource but rather should be read in addition to the main paper.**

In addition, the R script **cases_simstudy_paper_figures.R** allows to reproduce
the figures in the main paper.
