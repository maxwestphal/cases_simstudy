# \{cases\} simulation study

[Westphal \& Zapf, 2024](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09622802241236933) investigated different multiple comparison procedures (MCPs) for a certain type of analyis (e.g.) relevant in diagnostic accuracy studies, the so-called co-primary endpoint analysis.

The R package [{cases}](https://github.com/maxwestphal/cases/) contains user-friendly implementations of these MCPs.

This R project **cases_simstudy** contains a reproducible description of the implementation and results of this simulation study in form of a [quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books).  

The **rendered document** can be viewed on [https://maxwestphal.github.io/cases_simstudy](https://maxwestphal.github.io/cases_simstudy).
